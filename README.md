# Build your Own shell

MyShell is a lightweight and minimalistic shell built from scratch using C. It provides a basic command-line interface for executing Unix commands, handling processes, and managing files. This project is designed to deepen the understanding of operating system concepts like process creation, system calls, and input/output handling.

## Compilation and Running
To compile the shell, use the following command:
```
gcc -o my_shell main.c utils.c
```
To run the shell, execute:
```
./my_shell
