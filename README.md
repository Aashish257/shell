# Build your Own shell

MyShell is a lightweight and minimalistic shell built from scratch using java. It provides a basic command-line interface for executing Unix commands, handling processes, and managing files. This project is designed to deepen the understanding of operating system concepts like process creation, system calls, and input/output handling.
